# Simulation-of-Bloch-Beamline

A synchrotron is a type of particle accelerator useful for many types of advanced experiments. A **beamline** is the "laboratory" of a synchrotron. Different beamlines have different instruments and can consequently be used to analyse different experiments. In oder to time-optimize the usage of the beamlines, it is neccesary for experimental physicst to simulate there experiments beforehand. Since each beamline is different, a simulatation of **Each** beamline must be made.

The **Bloch beamline** was (in 2018) a newly developed beamline on the MAX IV synchrotron in Lund, Sweden. In this repository, I develiped the simulation for this beamline, as part of my bachelor project. Due to the intractability of particle physics, Monte Carlo simulations were used. In order to simulate different parts of the synchrotron, the McXtrace program was used, enableling the simulation using Ansi C language. 



## Report.

A simulation of the Bloch Beamline at the MAX IV synchrotron in Lund, Sweden. The simulation is implemented in the McXtrace meta-language using ANSI-C. For more information, see https://drive.google.com/file/d/147JWm2MlpUe59dIxO1wPQgaH87x1bp-w/view?usp=sharing
